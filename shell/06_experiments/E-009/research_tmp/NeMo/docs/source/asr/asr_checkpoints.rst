ASR Model Checkpoints
=======================

This page lists all supported ASR model checkpoints released by NVIDIA NeMo.
Benchmark scores for each model can be found on its `HuggingFace model card <https://huggingface.co/nvidia>`__.

For community fine-tunes built on these checkpoints, see :doc:`Featured Community Checkpoints <./featured_community_checkpoints>`.

Parakeet Models
-----------------

High-accuracy ASR models built on the FastConformer encoder architecture.
Parakeet, Nemotron Speech, and the ``stt_*_fastconformer_*`` models below all share the same underlying FastConformer encoder;
the different names reflect release branding, not architectural differences.

Loading Models
--------------

All models (except SALM — see :doc:`SpeechLM2 </speechlm2/intro>`) can be loaded via the ``from_pretrained()`` API:

.. code-block:: python

    import nemo.collections.asr as nemo_asr

    model = nemo_asr.models.ASRModel.from_pretrained("nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2")
