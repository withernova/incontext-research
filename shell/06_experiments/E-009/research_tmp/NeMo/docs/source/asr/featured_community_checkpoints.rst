Featured Community Checkpoints
==============================

Community fine-tunes built on NVIDIA NeMo ASR checkpoints and published on Hugging Face.
For NVIDIA-published checkpoints, see :doc:`./asr_checkpoints` and the `NVIDIA Hugging Face organization <https://huggingface.co/nvidia>`__.

.. note::

   Community checkpoints are maintained by their authors, not by the NeMo team.
   Use each model's Hugging Face model card and the framework project linked below for up-to-date setup and inference instructions.
