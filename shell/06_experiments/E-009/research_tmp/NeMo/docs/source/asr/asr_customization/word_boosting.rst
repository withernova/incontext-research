GPU-PB
========================

GPU-PB is a GPU-accelerated Phrase-Boosting method supported for CTC, RNN-T/TDT, and AED (Canary) models based on NGPU-LM infrastructure.
The method supports greedy and beam search decoding, including CUDA graphs mode. GPU-PB is compatible with NGPU-LM at the same decoding run.

GPU-PB is applied only at the decoding step in shallow fusion mode. You do not need to retrain the ASR model.
During greedy or beam search decoding, GPU-PB rescales ASR model scores with a boosting tree at the token level.
The boosting tree is built from a context phrases list, which is provided by the user.

**NOTE**: for ASR models that support capitalization by default (e.g., Canary or parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2), previously you
needed to capitalize (manually or by using LLM) all the key phrases in advance (and capitalize the full word for abbreviations). With ``boosting_tree.bpe_mode="case_insensitive"`` you no longer need to do this.

More details about GPU-PB method can be found in the `original paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07014>`__.

Usage
-----
We support the following ways to pass the context phrases into the decoding script:

1. Build a boosting tree for a specific ASR model (step 0.0) and use it for all the decoding evaluation by ``boosting_tree.model_path`` (step 1.1-3.1).
2. Provide a file with context phrases ``boosting_tree.key_phrases_file`` - one phrase per line  (step 1.1-3.1).
3. Provide a python list of context phrases ``boosting_tree.key_phrases_list`` (step 1.1-3.1).
4. Provide a list of phrases with annotations (e.g., language marks) ``boosting_tree.key_phrase_items_list``

The use of the Phrase-Boosting tree is controlled by ``boosting_tree`` config (``BoostingTreeModelConfig``) for all the models.
For prepared boosting tree use ``boosting_tree.model_path=${PATH_TO_BTREE}``.
We recommend to provide the list of context phrases directly into ``speech_to_text_eval.py`` by ``boosting_tree.key_phrases_file=${KEY_WORDS_LIST}``.

List of the most important parameters:

*  ``strategy`` - The strategy to use for decoding depending on the model type (CTC - greedy_batch or beam_batch; RNN-T/TDT - greedy_batch or malsd_batch; AED - beam).
*  ``model_path``, ``key_phrases_file``, ``key_phrases_list``, ``key_phrase_items_list`` - The way to pass the context phrases into the decoding script.
*  ``context_score`` - The score for each arc transition in the context graph (1.0 is recommended).
*  ``depth_scaling`` - The scaling factor for the depth of the context graph (2.0 is recommended for CTC, RNN-T and TDT, 1.0 for Canary).
*  ``boosting_tree_alpha`` - Weight of the GPU-PB boosting tree during shallow fusion decoding (tune it according to your data).
* ``bpe_mode`` - ``default`` (case-sensitive), ``case_insensitive``, and 2 experimental modes - ``bpe_dropout`` and ``var_bpe``. ``case_insensitive`` allows to provide phrases in arbitrary case with models that produce output with capitalization. The boosted phrases automatically will include all potential spellings (in different cases). E.g., to boost both "Hello" and "hello" you need to provide any spelling (e.g., "Hello", "hello" or "HELLO" - the case does not matter).
* ``var_bpe_scoring_temp`` - works with ``case_insensitive`` and ``var_bpe`` modes; default value of 10.0 is conservatively safe, but values ``0.1 ... 2.0`` can provide better results with beam search and small lists or words.

.. _word_boosting_per_stream:

Per-Stream Phrase Boosting
==========================

Per-stream (per-utterance) phrase boosting extends GPU-PB to allow specifying different key phrases for each audio stream or utterance in a batch.
This is useful when different utterances require different context biasing (e.g., different speaker names, product terms, or domain vocabulary per audio).

Per-stream boosting is currently supported for **greedy label-looping decoding with Transducers (RNN-T, TDT)**, including cache-aware streaming models.

Manifest-based Usage
--------------------

Specify per-utterance key phrases in your manifest using the ``biasing_request`` field:

.. code-block:: json

    {"audio_filepath": "/data/file1.wav", "text": "ground truth", "biasing_request": {"boosting_model_cfg": {"key_phrases_list": ["one phrase"]}}}
    {"audio_filepath": "/data/file2.wav", "text": "ground truth", "biasing_request": {"boosting_model_cfg": {"key_phrases_list": ["other phrases", "and this one"]}}}

Use the streaming inference script with ``use_per_stream_biasing=true``:

.. code-block:: bash

    python examples/asr/asr_streaming_inference/asr_streaming_infer.py \
        --config-path="../conf/asr_streaming_inference/" \
        --config-name=cache_aware_rnnt.yaml \
        audio_file="<manifest_with_boosting_requests>" \
        output_filename="result.jsonl" \
        asr.model_name="nvidia/parakeet-rnnt-1.1b" \
        asr.decoding.greedy.enable_per_stream_biasing=True

Python API Usage
----------------

.. code-block:: python

    from omegaconf import open_dict
    from nemo.collections.asr.models import EncDecRNNTBPEModel
    from nemo.collections.asr.parts.context_biasing.biasing_multi_model import BiasingRequestItemConfig
    from nemo.collections.asr.parts.context_biasing.boosting_graph_batched import BoostingTreeModelConfig
    from nemo.collections.asr.parts.utils.rnnt_utils import Hypothesis

    asr_model = EncDecRNNTBPEModel.from_pretrained("nvidia/parakeet-rnnt-1.1b")
    asr_model.to("cuda")

    with open_dict(asr_model.cfg.decoding):
        asr_model.cfg.decoding.strategy = "greedy_batch"
        asr_model.cfg.decoding.greedy.loop_labels = True
        asr_model.cfg.decoding.greedy.enable_per_stream_biasing = True
    asr_model.change_decoding_strategy(asr_model.cfg.decoding)

    biasing_requests = [
        BiasingRequestItemConfig(
            boosting_model_cfg=BoostingTreeModelConfig(key_phrases_list=["one phrase"]),
            boosting_model_alpha=2.0,
        ),
        None,  # no biasing for this utterance
        BiasingRequestItemConfig(
            boosting_model_cfg=BoostingTreeModelConfig(key_phrases_list=["other phrases"]),
            boosting_model_alpha=1.0,
        ),
    ]

    results = asr_model.transcribe(
        audio=["file1.wav", "file2.wav", "file3.wav"],
        partial_hypothesis=[
            Hypothesis.empty_with_biasing_cfg(biasing_cfg=req) if req else None
            for req in biasing_requests
        ],
        return_hypotheses=True,
    )

Caching
-------

Building a boosting model from a phrase list has some overhead. NeMo provides caching mechanisms to speed up repeated use of the same phrases:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 60 25

   * - Strategy
     - Description
     - Recommended For
   * - Memory
     - Set ``cache_key`` on ``BiasingRequestItemConfig`` to cache compiled models in memory by a string key.
     - Repeated phrase sets
   * - Disk
     - Set ``model_path`` on ``BoostingTreeModelConfig`` to save/load compiled models from disk.
     - Persistent caching
   * - Decoder
     - Set ``auto_manage_multi_model=False`` and manually manage models in the decoder's multi-model.
     - Advanced use cases

With memory caching, per-stream boosting achieves near-zero overhead compared to global (shared) boosting.


.. _word_boosting_flashlight:

Flashlight-based Word Boosting
==============================


The Flashlight decoder supports word boosting during CTC decoding using a KenLM binary and corresponding lexicon. Word boosting only works in lexicon-decoding mode and does not function in lexicon-free mode. It allows you to bias the decoder for certain words by manually increasing or decreasing the probability of emitting specific words. This can be very helpful if you have uncommon or industry-specific terms that you want to ensure are transcribed correctly.

For more information, go to `word boosting <https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/riva/user-guide/docs/asr/asr-customizing.html#word-boosting>`__

To use word boosting in NeMo, create a simple tab-separated text file. Each line should contain a word to be boosted, followed by a tab, and then the boosted score for that word.

For example:

.. code-block::

    nvidia	40
    geforce	50
    riva	80
    turing	30
    badword	-100

Positive scores boost words higher in the LM decoding step so they show up more frequently, whereas negative scores
squelch words so they show up less frequently. The recommended range for the boost score is +/- 20 to 100.

The boost file handles both in-vocabulary words and OOV words just fine, so you can specify both IV and OOV words with corresponding scores.

You can then pass this file to your Flashlight config object during decoding:

.. code-block::

    # Lexicon-based decoding
    python eval_beamsearch_ngram_ctc.py ... \
           decoding_strategy="flashlight" \
           decoding.beam.flashlight_cfg.lexicon_path='/path/to/lexicon.lexicon' \
           decoding.beam.flashlight_cfg.boost_path='/path/to/my_boost_file.boost' \
           decoding.beam.flashlight_cfg.beam_size_token = 32 \
           decoding.beam.flashlight_cfg.beam_threshold = 25.0

.. _word_boosting_ctcws:

CTC-WS: Context-biasing (Word Boosting) without External LM
===========================================================

NeMo toolkit supports a fast context-biasing method for CTC and Transducer (RNN-T) ASR models with CTC-based Word Spotter.
The method involves decoding CTC log probabilities with a context graph built for words and phrases from the context-biasing list.
The spotted context-biasing candidates (with their scores and time intervals) are compared by scores with words from the greedy CTC decoding results to improve recognition accuracy and prevent false accepts of context-biasing.

A Hybrid Transducer-CTC model (a shared encoder trained together with CTC and Transducer output heads) enables the use of the CTC-WS method for the Transducer model.
Context-biasing candidates obtained by CTC-WS are also filtered by the scores with greedy CTC predictions and then merged with greedy Transducer results.

Scheme of the CTC-WS method:

    :width: 80%

More details about CTC-WS context-biasing can be found in the `tutorial <https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Speech/tree/main/tutorials/asr/ASR_Context_Biasing.ipynb>`__.

To use CTC-WS context-biasing, you need to create a context-biasing text file that contains words/phrases to be boosted, with its transcriptions (spellings) separated by underscore.
Multiple transcriptions can be useful for abbreviations ("gpu" -> "g p u"), compound words ("nvlink" -> "nv link"), 
or words with common mistakes in the case of our ASR model ("nvidia" -> "n video").

Example of the context-biasing file:

.. code-block::

    nvidia_nvidia
    omniverse_omniverse
    gpu_gpu_g p u
    dgx_dgx_d g x_d gx
    nvlink_nvlink_nv link
    ray tracing_ray tracing

The main script for CTC-WS context-biasing in NeMo is: 

.. code-block::

    {NEMO_DIR_PATH}/scripts/asr_context_biasing/eval_greedy_decoding_with_context_biasing.py

Context-biasing is managed by ``apply_context_biasing`` parameter [true or false].
Other important context-biasing parameters are:

*  ``beam_threshold`` - threshold for CTC-WS beam pruning.
*  ``context_score`` - per token weight for context biasing.
*  ``ctc_ali_token_weight`` - per token weight for CTC alignment (prevents false acceptances of context-biasing words).

All the context-biasing parameters are selected according to the default values in the script.
You can tune them according to your data and ASR model (list all the values in the [] separated by commas)
for example: ``beam_threshold=[7.0,8.0,9.0]``, ``context_score=[3.0,4.0,5.0]``, ``ctc_ali_token_weight=[0.5,0.6,0.7]``.
The script will run the recognition with all the combinations of the parameters and will select the best one based on WER value.

.. code-block::

    # Context-biasing with the CTC-WS method for CTC ASR model 
    python {NEMO_DIR_PATH}/scripts/asr_context_biasing/eval_greedy_decoding_with_context_biasing.py \
            nemo_model_file={ctc_model_name} \
            input_manifest={test_nemo_manifest} \
            preds_output_folder={exp_dir} \
            decoder_type="ctc" \
            acoustic_batch_size=64 \
            apply_context_biasing=true \
            context_file={cb_list_file_modified} \
            beam_threshold=[7.0] \
            context_score=[3.0] \
            ctc_ali_token_weight=[0.5]

To use Transducer head of the Hybrid Transducer-CTC model, you need to set ``decoder_type=rnnt``.
