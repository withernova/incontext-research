Training and Scaling
====================

This page provides detailed information on training speechlm2 models, including setup requirements, running experiments at scale, debugging, and parallelism strategies.

Running Experiments
-------------------

The speechlm2 collection includes several scripts to facilitate running experiments, especially on SLURM-based clusters.

SLURM Job Submission
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For training on SLURM clusters, use the following workflow:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Submit 8 consecutive jobs with random seeds
    scripts/speechlm2/auto_launcher_with_seed.sh -n8 s2s_tinyllama_repro.sub

The ``auto_launcher_with_seed.sh`` script:

1. Generates a random seed for each submitted job
2. Leverages ``shard_seed="randomized"`` in Lhotse to ensure each data parallel rank is seeded differently
3. Ensures each tensor parallel rank is seeded identically

SLURM Submission Script
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Example ``s2s_tinyllama_repro.sub`` script:

.. code-block:: bash

    #!/bin/bash
    #SBATCH --job-name=s2s_training
    #SBATCH --nodes=4
    #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=8
    #SBATCH --gres=gpu:8
    #SBATCH --time=24:00:00
    #SBATCH --exclusive
    #SBATCH --output=s2s_tinyllama_repro_%j.out

    # Check that the global random seed base is provided
    if [ -z "$1" ]; then
      echo "Usage: $0 <global_random_seed_base>"
      exit 1
    fi
    SEED=${1}

    EXP_NAME="s2s_training"
    RESULTS_DIR="results/${EXP_NAME}"

    srun --ntasks=${SLURM_NTASKS} --ntasks-per-node=${SLURM_NTASKS_PER_NODE} \
      python -u examples/speechlm2/s2s_duplex_train.py \
      --config-path=/path/to/config/dir \
      --config-name=s2s_training.yaml \
      exp_manager.name=${EXP_NAME} \
      exp_manager.wandb_logger_kwargs.name=${EXP_NAME} \
      trainer.num_nodes=$SLURM_JOB_NUM_NODES \
      exp_manager.explicit_log_dir=${RESULTS_DIR} \
      data.train_ds.seed=$SEED \
      data.validation_ds.seed=$SEED


Configuration Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The main configuration file (``s2s_training.yaml``) contains all model, training, and data parameters. See :doc:`configs` for more details. It's recommended to copy and modify this file rather than overriding options in the SLURM script to maintain versioning and configuration clarity.

Debugging
---------

Running Locally with torchrun
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For local debugging and profiling, use ``torchrun``:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Run with 4 GPUs locally
    torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 examples/speechlm2/s2s_duplex_train.py \
      --config-path=/path/to/config/dir \
      --config-name=s2s_training.yaml

Scaling Strategies
------------------

The speechlm2 collection includes support for model parallelism to scale training to large models across multiple GPUs.

Model Parallel Strategies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The collection supports multiple parallelism strategies:

1. **Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP2)**: Distributes model parameters across GPUs
2. **Tensor Parallelism (TP)**: Splits individual tensors across GPUs
3. **Sequence Parallelism (SP)**: Splits sequence processing across GPUs
4. **2D Parallelism**: Combination of FSDP2 with TP/SP

AutomodelParallelStrategy (SALMAutomodel)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For ``SALMAutomodel``, the collection provides ``AutomodelParallelStrategy`` which
delegates topology resolution and parallelism to NeMo Automodel. The strategy can
construct topologies for FSDP2, TP, PP, CP, EP (MoE), and HSDP, but actual
support depends on the selected LLM architecture, backend, and combination of
parallelism axes.

.. code-block:: yaml

    trainer:
      strategy:
        _target_: nemo.collections.speechlm2.parts.parallel.AutomodelParallelStrategy
        dp_size: null       # inferred from world_size / other dims
        dp_replicate_size: 1  # HSDP replication group size
        tp_size: 1
        pp_size: 1
        cp_size: 1
        ep_size: 8          # Expert parallelism for MoE models

        # Activation checkpointing — two independent knobs:
        activation_checkpointing_llm: false         # LLM transformer blocks
        activation_checkpointing_perception: false  # speech encoder layers

The model's ``configure_model()`` receives a resolved ``distributed_setup`` and
passes it to Automodel's ``from_pretrained`` for memory-efficient loading
(each GPU only loads its own shard). ``SALMAutomodel`` currently rejects
``pp_size > 1``; use pipeline parallelism only after model integration adds
pipeline execution support.

The speech encoder / perception module currently only supports FSDP2 (controlled via ``dp_size``).

Activation Checkpointing
""""""""""""""""""""""""

``AutomodelParallelStrategy`` exposes two independent activation-checkpointing knobs:

* ``activation_checkpointing_llm`` — single switch covering both the non-EP FSDP2
  path (forces ``FSDP2Config.activation_checkpointing=True``) and the EP/MoE
  parallelizer path (passed through as a separate runtime arg). Use this for
  MoE LLMs whether ``ep_size`` is 1 or larger.
* ``activation_checkpointing_perception`` — wraps each transformer layer in
  ``perception.encoder.layers`` (and the Conformer ``pre_encode`` front-end when
  it isn't a bare ``nn.Linear``) with ``checkpoint_wrapper`` *before* FSDP2
  sharding. Implemented in ``AudioPerceptionModule.set_activation_checkpointing``.

Both default to ``false``. Toggle them independently to trade compute for
memory at either end of the model. They are SALMAutomodel-specific knobs (the
HF Transformers SALM path uses HuggingFace's own gradient-checkpointing API).

.. note::
   Expert Parallelism (EP) reuses the FSDP2 data-parallel axis (``dp_size``).
   Dense layers are sharded via FSDP2, while MoE expert layers use EP for
   all-to-all expert routing — both operate on the same set of GPUs.
   Setting ``ep_size`` controls how many GPUs participate in expert routing;
   it does not add a separate dimension.

Training with MoE LLM Backbones
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

SALMAutomodel enables efficient training of Speech LLMs with Mixture-of-Experts
backbones like `NVIDIA Nemotron Nano V3 <https://huggingface.co/nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B-BF16>`_
(30B total parameters, 3B active). NeMo Automodel provides two key MoE
optimizations:

* **Grouped GEMM**: Fuses all expert computations within a single MoE layer into
  one batched matrix multiplication, maximizing GPU utilization and throughput.
* **DeepEP** (Deep Expert Parallelism): An efficient all-to-all communication
  primitive for routing tokens to experts across GPUs, significantly reducing the
  communication overhead of Expert Parallelism.

.. important::
   For the native Nemotron-V3 backbone, the validated ``SALMAutomodel``
   parallelism axes are FSDP2, EP, and CP. CP requires packed sequences and
   Transformer Engine attention, as described in the Context Parallelism
   section below.

   Nemotron-V3 does not provide a TP plan, so set ``tp_size: 1``. HSDP is not
   supported in this path, so set ``dp_replicate_size: 1``. PP has not been
   validated for this SpeechLM2 configuration, so set ``pp_size: 1``.

Example: training SALMAutomodel with Nemotron Nano V3 on 8 GPUs with EP=8:

.. code-block:: bash

    torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 examples/speechlm2/salm_train.py \
      --config-name=salm_automodel \
      model.pretrained_llm=nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B-BF16 \
      trainer.strategy.ep_size=8

For distributed inference, launch with ``torchrun``:

.. code-block:: bash

    torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 examples/speechlm2/salm_eval.py \
      pretrained_name=path/to/checkpoint \
      inputs=path/to/manifest \
      ep_size=2

Packed Sequences (THD)
""""""""""""""""""""""

``SALMAutomodel`` supports an opt-in packed-sequence (``THD``) training and
validation path that concatenates per-utterance text + audio embeddings into
a single flat ``[T_total, H]`` sequence with a ``cu_seqlens`` index, instead
of right-padding into the standard ``[B, T_max, H]`` (``BSHD``) layout. TE's
varlen FlashAttention then operates segment-by-segment without ever attending
across utterances, and Mamba's ``seq_idx`` is derived from the same
``cu_seqlens`` so SSM state resets at document boundaries.

For variable-length speech batches the padding overhead is substantial — the
``BSHD`` layout pays ``B * (T_max - T_avg)`` wasted compute per minibatch,
``THD`` pays only the per-utterance rounding to a multiple of ``2*cp_size``
(needed for TE's CP DualChunkSwap pattern). Throughput improvement scales
with the variance of utterance lengths.

Enable per-batch:

.. code-block:: yaml

    model:
      packed_sequences: true   # opt-in; default false (BSHD)
      automodel_backend:
        attn: te                # THD path requires TE attention

When ``packed_sequences`` is unset, the existing BSHD path is used unchanged.
Generate / inference always uses BSHD (it doesn't go through ``prepare_inputs``).

Context Parallelism (CP)
""""""""""""""""""""""""

``SALMAutomodel`` supports context parallelism for long-audio training on
hybrid Mamba/attention LLMs (e.g. Nemotron-V3). CP shards the sequence
dimension across GPUs so per-rank activations and KV-cache memory scale as
``T / cp_size`` instead of ``T``; attention layers go through TE's
DualChunkSwap pattern and Mamba mixers go through hidden-parallel
all-to-all (``MambaContextParallel`` in NeMo Automodel).

Enable via the strategy:

.. code-block:: yaml

    trainer:
      strategy:
        _target_: nemo.collections.speechlm2.parts.parallel.AutomodelParallelStrategy
        cp_size: 2          # context parallel size; must divide num_heads of every Mamba block
        ep_size: 2          # may share the same ranks as CP

**The THD packed-sequence path is the only supported configuration under
CP.** Each utterance is its own attention segment and the per-utterance
sequence rounding aligns naturally with CP's ``2*cp_size`` requirement.

.. warning::
   **BSHD + CP is not supported.** TE's fused-attention CP path supports
   ``causal`` but not ``padding_causal``, so the right-pad mask must be
   dropped before the LLM. With the mask dropped, pad K/V leak into
   real-token attention through the causal mask and the gradient through
   the LoRA / projection parameters becomes ``NaN`` after the first
   optimizer step (validated empirically: BSHD + CP=2 + EP=2 on a 2-GPU
   run produces ``loss=4.62`` at step 1 then ``loss=nan`` from step 2
   onwards). This is independent of the TE/cuDNN backward issue
   documented below — setting ``NVTE_FUSED_ATTN=0`` does not fix it.
   Set ``model.packed_sequences: true`` to use the THD path instead.

.. note::
   **CP-safe data loading is automatic.** The speechlm2 datamodule wraps
   the Lhotse loader in
   :class:`~nemo.collections.common.data.lhotse.broadcasting.BroadcastingDataLoader`,
   so under CP/TP every batch is constructed once on the DP source rank
   (``cp_rank == 0`` and ``tp_rank == 0``) and broadcast to its sub-mesh
   peers. This eliminates per-rank Lhotse non-determinism (``concurrent_bucketing``,
   worker scheduling jitter, etc.) as a source of NCCL deadlocks under CP.
   See :doc:`/dataloaders` for the standalone API.

.. note::
   **TE/THD exploding-gradients workaround on some GPUs.** On certain GPU
   architectures (notably Blackwell ``sm_120``), the cuDNN backend that
   TransformerEngine 2.14 picks for ``qkv_format="thd"`` with
   ``attn_mask_type="padding_causal"`` returns correct forward activations
   but gradients amplified 8×–960× per layer. Compounded across the LLM's
   attention stack this drives gradients to ``1e22``-magnitudes at step 0,
   the gradient-clip-by-norm computes ``1.0 / inf = 0``, and Adam's moments
   eventually NaN. Force TE to dispatch FlashAttention instead of cuDNN by
   setting ``NVTE_FUSED_ATTN=0`` in the launcher environment (requires
   ``flash-attn`` to be installed for your GPU arch). The FlashAttention
   THD/``padding_causal`` backward is gradient-correct on the same shapes.

To configure parallelism, modify the ``trainer.strategy`` section in your YAML config:

.. code-block:: yaml

    trainer:
      strategy:
        _target_: nemo.core.ModelParallelStrategy
        find_unused_parameters: False
        data_parallel: 1   # World size for data parallelism (FSDP2)
        tensor_parallel: 8  # World size for tensor parallelism
      devices: 8
      num_nodes: 1
      accelerator: gpu
      precision: bf16-true

The model's ``configure_model`` method automatically sets up the appropriate parallelization based on this configuration.

FSDP2 Configuration (HF Automodel)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For Fully Sharded Data Parallel training:

1. Set ``data_parallel`` to the number of GPUs you want to use for data parallelism
2. Set ``tensor_parallel`` to 1 (disabled)

FSDP2 shards the model parameters across GPUs, all-gathers them for forward/backward passes, and then de-allocates after computation. This allows training of larger models with limited GPU memory.
See `PyTorch FSDP2 <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.fsdp.fully_shard.html>`_ for more details.

Tensor Parallelism Configuration (HF Automodel)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For Tensor Parallelism:

1. Set ``tensor_parallel`` to the number of GPUs you want to use for tensor parallelism
2. Set ``data_parallel`` to 1 (or higher for 2D parallelism)

The ``parallelize_module`` function applies a parallelization plan to specific model components, like splitting attention heads or embedding dimensions across GPUs.
See `PyTorch TP <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.tensor.parallel.html>`_ for more details.

Implementation Details
----------------------

The core implementation of model parallelism is in the ``configure_model`` method of the model classes. Key aspects include:

1. **Module Sharding**: Calling ``fully_shard`` on modules to distribute parameters across data parallel ranks
2. **Parallelization Plans**: Creating and applying plans that specify how different layers should be parallelized
3. **Model-Specific Adaptations**: Handling architectural differences between different LLMs

Advanced Usage
--------------

Script Customization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When customizing the training scripts, keep these points in mind:

1. **Path Overrides**: Override paths in the YAML configuration files with your own, as needed
2. **W&B Keys**: Update Weights & Biases API keys in configuration files
3. **Batch Size Tuning**: Adjust batch size based on your GPU memory and model size
