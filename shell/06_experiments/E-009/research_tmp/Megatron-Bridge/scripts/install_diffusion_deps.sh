# Install the WAN diffusion codecs (imageio, imageio-ffmpeg, av) into the active
# environment at test time. All three carry CVEs and are excluded from the shipped
# container via [tool.uv] override-dependencies (each marked `sys_platform == 'never'`),
# so neither the build nor `uv sync` installs them and they appear only as `never`-marked
# edges in uv.lock.
#
# Install them directly with `uv pip install --no-config`: --no-config ignores the
# project's [tool.uv] config, so the `sys_platform == 'never'` override does not
# neutralize the install. The requirements lock pins each version and accepted artifact
# digest so CI never executes mutable package contents from the index.
