# CI/CD

## Commit and PR Workflow

- **Never commit directly to `main`** — always create a feature branch.
- **Always sign commits**: `git commit -s -m "message"`.
- **PR title format**: [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) — `<type>(<scope>): <description>`
  (e.g., `feat(model): add Qwen3 model bridge`).
See @CONTRIBUTING.md for the full PR workflow, type/scope taxonomy, and DCO requirements.

## How CI Is Triggered

The workflow is defined in @.github/workflows/cicd-main.yml and is triggered
on `push` — **not** on `pull_request`. This is intentional: a bot called
`copy-pr-bot` controls when CI runs.

**Mechanism:**
1. When a PR is opened, `copy-pr-bot` watches for a trust signal.
2. Trust is established in one of two ways:
   - All commits on the PR branch are **GPG-signed** by a verified NVIDIA contributor → bot triggers automatically.
   - An NVIDIAN posts `/ok to test <commit-sha>` as a PR comment → bot triggers manually for that SHA.
3. Once trusted, `copy-pr-bot` copies the PR's code into the remote branch
   `pull-request/<number>` and pushes it.
4. That push fires the workflow's `push` trigger on `refs/heads/pull-request/<number>`,
   launching CI.

**Consequences:**
- CI never runs on untrusted pushes — external contributors always need `/ok to test`.
- The running workflow branch is `pull-request/<number>`, not the author's feature branch.
- Pushing a new commit to a PR does **not** automatically re-trigger CI unless the
  commit is signed or `/ok to test <new-sha>` is posted.
- Concurrent runs for the same PR are cancelled automatically (concurrency group per PR number).

## Pipeline Structure

```
pre-flight
  └── lint-check
        └── cicd-wait-in-queue       # queues workflows to avoid runner interleaving across PRs
              └── cicd-container-build
                    ├── unit-tests-core
                    ├── unit-tests-diffusion
                    └── functional-tests (L0 always; L1 with needs-more-tests label; L2 on schedule or full-test-suite label)
```

- Slack notifications are sent on completion for scheduled and nightly runs.

For functional test tier semantics and job-to-directory mapping, see the `testing` skill.

## CI Failure Investigation

### Locating the PR from a CI Branch

```bash
# Extract PR number from branch name (e.g. pull-request/1234)
PR_NUMBER=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD | grep -oP '(?<=pull-request/)\d+')

gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --repo NVIDIA-NeMo/Megatron-Bridge
gh pr diff "$PR_NUMBER" --repo NVIDIA-NeMo/Megatron-Bridge --name-only
gh pr checks "$PR_NUMBER" --repo NVIDIA-NeMo/Megatron-Bridge
```

### Investigating a Failing Job

1. **Get the PR number** from the branch name (see above).
2. **Review the changeset**:
   ```bash
   gh pr diff "$PR_NUMBER" --repo NVIDIA-NeMo/Megatron-Bridge
   ```
3. **Identify the failing job** from `gh pr checks` output.
4. **Fetch job logs**:
   ```bash
   gh run list --repo NVIDIA-NeMo/Megatron-Bridge --branch "pull-request/$PR_NUMBER"
   gh run view <run_id> --repo NVIDIA-NeMo/Megatron-Bridge --log-failed > run.log
   ```
5. **Scan logs in chunks** — log files can exceed 10,000 lines, never load them whole:
   ```bash
   wc -l run.log
   tail -200 run.log          # start from the end
   sed -n '1,200p' run.log    # or scan forward in 200-line chunks
   ```
6. **Cross-reference the changeset** against the failing step.

### Hugging Face Model Access In CI

Assume CI functional-test containers run with Hugging Face models offline
(`HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1`) and a pre-populated `HF_HOME`. When reproducing or
fixing CI failures involving HF models, mirror this locally by setting
`HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1` after warming the cache. Test fixtures must not depend on
live Hub API calls such as `list_repo_files()` or uncached downloads during CI.
For `trust_remote_code=True` toy checkpoints, copy custom Python modules from
the already loaded local/cache source files or a local snapshot, not by listing
the remote repo at test time.

## Common Failure Patterns

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Action |
|---|---|---|
| CI never started on a PR | Commits not GPG-signed and no `/ok to test` comment | Post `/ok to test <full-sha>` on the PR |
| Lint job fails | `ruff` or `pre-commit` violation | Run `ruff check --fix` + `ruff format` locally |
| Container build fails | Dependency conflict or stale `uv.lock` | Re-run `uv lock` inside Docker and commit updated lock |
| Unit tests fail | Code regression or missing import | Run failing test locally; check the PR diff |
| Functional test (L0) fails | Integration breakage | Check GPU runner logs; reproduce with `L0_Launch_*.sh` |
| HF model fixture passes locally but fails in CI with `OfflineModeIsEnabled` | Test made a live Hugging Face Hub API/download call; CI has `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1` | Warm local cache, reproduce with `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1`, and change the fixture to use cached/local artifacts only |
| `cicd-wait-in-queue` running long | Many PRs queued; automation serializes runners to avoid interleaving | Wait; or check queue depth in the Actions tab |
| MCore submodule mismatch | Pinned commit out of sync | Update `3rdparty/Megatron-LM` submodule and re-lock |
| Stale checkpoint auto-resume | `nemo_experiments/` from a previous run exists | `rm -rf nemo_experiments` before starting fresh |
| Port collision on Slurm (EADDRINUSE) | `ntasks-per-node=8` with `torchrun` | Drop torchrun; use `ntasks-per-node=8` with `uv run python script.py` |
