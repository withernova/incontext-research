"""Sequence-packing assembly for MegatronMIMO language shards.

Concatenates the real (unpadded) tokens of a group of examples into a single
packed sequence — the Transformer Engine ``thd`` layout (total-tokens × heads × head-dim) —
with ``cu_seqlens`` boundaries. Downstream, the ``cu_seqlens`` make attention block-diagonal
per example (the qwen3-vl attention / flash-attn path already honors this), so packing does
not leak attention across examples.

This module packs the **whole shard** as one group — there is no per-pack length budget here,
so the assembled pack is the entire shard.

    ``tokens`` may be ``None`` on a non-first PP stage that has no ``input_ids`` but still must

    that case ``input_ids`` is ``None`` in the result and the device is taken from the first
    available tensor.

    Args:
        group: Row indices (into the source tensors) of the examples in this pack, in pack order.
        tokens: Padded ``[B, S]`` token ids, or ``None`` (last-stage label-only pack).

            3-D ``[3, B, S]`` are handled; each sample's real slice is concatenated, so the

    Concatenates the shard's real (unpadded) tokens — including image-placeholder tokens, so
    the downstream MIMO modality splice still fills them in order — into one packed sequence with
    ``cu_seqlens`` block-diagonal boundaries. This removes the per-sample padding compute (the
    LM no longer processes ``S``-padded sequences) and makes attention cost ∝ real tokens.

    The returned ``packing_kwargs`` feeds ``MimoModel.forward(packing_kwargs=...)``, which
    builds a THD ``PackedSeqParams`` (``qkv_format='thd'``) and threads ``cu_seqlens`` to the
    GPT decoder for block-diagonal attention. Non-LM tensors (``modality_inputs``, etc.) are
    carried through unchanged.

    The per-sample real length comes **only** from the caller-supplied ``lengths``
    (``forward_step`` derives it from the batch's ``attention_mask`` on every language stage,
    so all stages pack to an identical ``[1, T]``). ``None`` returns the batch unchanged.
