    Calculate the 3D rope index for Qwen3-ASR.

    Simplified version for audio-only model: just cumulative position IDs
    expanded to 3 MRoPE dimensions. No special vision/video handling needed.

    Ported from HF Qwen3ASRPreTrainedModelForConditionalGeneration.get_rope_index.

    Args:
        input_ids: Input token IDs of shape (batch_size, sequence_length).
        attention_mask: Attention mask of shape (batch_size, sequence_length).

    Returns:
        Tuple containing ``position_ids`` of shape ``(3, batch_size, sequence_length)``
        and ``mrope_position_deltas`` of shape ``(batch_size, 1)``.
