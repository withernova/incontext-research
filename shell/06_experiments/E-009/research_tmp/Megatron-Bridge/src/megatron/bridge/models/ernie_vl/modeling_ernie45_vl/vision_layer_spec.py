"""
Layer spec for the ERNIE 4.5 VL Megatron-native Vision Transformer (ViT).

Provides ``get_ernie_vit_layer_spec()`` which returns a ``ModuleSpec`` for a
single ViT transformer layer using Transformer Engine modules.

The spec is identical to the standard MCore ViT spec from
``megatron.core.models.vision.vit_layer_specs.get_vit_layer_with_transformer_engine_spec``
except that ``self_attention.module`` is overridden with ``ErnieVLSelfAttention``
to handle absolute 2D RoPE (non-interleaved rotate_half style).

Architecture details:
    - Attention: TELayerNormColumnParallelLinear (fused QKV + LN)
                 + TEDotProductAttention
                 + TERowParallelLinear
    - MLP:       TELayerNormColumnParallelLinear (fused fc1 + LN)
                 + TERowParallelLinear
    - Mask type: AttnMaskType.no_mask (bidirectional attention for ViT)
    - pre_mlp_layernorm: IdentityOp (LN is fused into TE linear layers)
