"""Step3.7 transformer config and vision-config helper.

Mirrors ``qwen_vl/modelling_qwen3_vl/transformer_config.py``: the text-side
config is the standard Megatron ``TransformerConfig`` already used by Step-3.5,
extended with vision-tower fields. The HF ``StepRoboticsVisionEncoderConfig``
is passed straight through to the Megatron vision module — no separate
Megatron-side ``TransformerConfig`` is constructed for the vision tower, since
the PE-G/14 trunk does not use any Megatron tensor-parallel primitives.
