# Activation Recomputation

The input activations of network layers are stored in device memory and are used
to compute gradients during back-propagation. When training a model with long
sequences, large micro-batches, or heavy MoE memory pressure, these activations
can quickly saturate device memory. Checkpointing some activations and
recomputing the rest is a common way to trade extra compute for lower memory
use.

Activation recomputation in Megatron Bridge is configured through the model
provider's recomputation parameters, which are based on Megatron Core's
`TransformerConfig`.

## Quick Guidance

As a rule of thumb:

- start with **selective recomputation** before using full recomputation
- use **full recomputation** only when selective recomputation still does not fit
- for MoE and long-context training, prefer recomputing smaller modules such as
  normalization, activation, MoE-side, or model-specific up-projection work
  rather than recomputing the whole layer
- revisit recomputation after enabling CUDA graphs, because TE-scoped graphs and
  full recomputation are not always compatible

## Transformer Layer Recomputation

Megatron Bridge supports transformer layer recomputation, which checkpoints the
input of each transformer layer and recomputes the activations for the
remaining layers. This technique significantly reduces activation memory usage.
However, it also adds a large compute cost because the whole layer forward is
executed again during backward.

Megatron Bridge also supports partial transformer layer recomputation, which is
useful when recomputing only some layers is enough to make the model fit.

### Configuration

Transformer layer recomputation is configured through the model provider's recomputation parameters:

```python
from megatron.bridge.models import GPTModelProvider

# Full recomputation - recompute all layers
model_config = GPTModelProvider(
    recompute_granularity="full",  # Enable full layer recomputation
    recompute_method="uniform",    # Uniform distribution across layers
    recompute_num_layers=4,        # Number of layers per recomputation block
    # ... other model parameters
)
```

### Recomputation Methods

#### Block Method
Recomputes a specific number of transformer layers per pipeline stage:

```python
model_config = GPTModelProvider(
    recompute_granularity="full",
    recompute_method="block",      # Block-wise recomputation
    recompute_num_layers=4,        # Recompute 4 layers per pipeline stage
)
```

#### Uniform Method
Uniformly divides the total number of transformer layers and recomputes input activations for each divided chunk:

```python
model_config = GPTModelProvider(
    recompute_granularity="full",
    recompute_method="uniform",    # Uniform distribution
    recompute_num_layers=8,        # Number of layers per recomputation block
)
```

### Pipeline Parallelism Considerations

When training with pipeline parallelism:
- `recompute_num_layers` indicates the layers per pipeline stage
- When using virtual pipelining, `recompute_num_layers` specifies the number of layers per virtual pipeline stage
- The framework automatically handles recomputation coordination across pipeline stages

## Self-attention Recomputation

Megatron Bridge supports selective self-attention recomputation that checkpoints the inputs of each self-attention block and recomputes the intermediate input activations. This cost-efficient method achieves high memory savings with minimal recomputation cost.

The intermediate layers of the self-attention block account for a large share
of activation memory because softmax, dropout, and QKV dot-product attention
scale with sequence length squared. Their recomputation cost is often lower than
recomputing the larger projection-heavy parts of the layer.

### Configuration

Self-attention recomputation is enabled using selective granularity:

```python
from megatron.bridge.models import GPTModelProvider

model_config = GPTModelProvider(
    recompute_granularity="selective",  # Enable selective recomputation
    recompute_modules=["core_attn"],    # Recompute attention modules (default)
    # ... other model parameters
)
```

### Recomputation Modules

Megatron Bridge supports selective recomputation for various modules:

```python
model_config = GPTModelProvider(
    recompute_granularity="selective",
    recompute_modules=[
        "core_attn",      # Core attention computation (default)
        "mlp",            # MLP layers
        "layernorm",      # Layer normalization
        "moe",            # Mixture of Experts layers
        "moe_act",        # MoE activation functions
        "shared_experts", # Shared expert layers
        "mla_up_proj",    # Multi-Latent Attention up projection
    ],
)
```

### Flash Attention Integration

Self-attention recomputation is automatically enabled when using Flash Attention
through Transformer Engine. Flash Attention already recovers some memory by
recomputing attention scores rather than storing them, so extra explicit
attention recomputation is often less important than recomputing other modules.

## Advanced Recomputation Configuration

### Distributed Activation Checkpointing

For models using model parallelism, you can distribute saved activations across the model parallel group:

```python
model_config = GPTModelProvider(
    recompute_granularity="selective",
    distribute_saved_activations=True,  # Distribute across model parallel group
    # Note: Cannot be used with sequence_parallel=True
)
```

### Memory vs Computation Trade-offs

Different recomputation strategies offer different memory-computation trade-offs:

- **Selective recomputation**: Usually the best first choice. Targets the most
  memory-expensive operations while keeping the compute penalty relatively low.
- **Full recomputation**: Strongest memory reduction, but also the highest
  compute overhead.
- **No recomputation**: Best for throughput when the model already fits.

### MoE-Specific Recomputation

For Mixture of Experts models, specialized recomputation options are available:

```python
model_config = GPTModelProvider(
    # MoE configuration
    num_moe_experts=8,
    expert_model_parallel_size=2,
    
    # MoE recomputation
    recompute_granularity="selective",
    recompute_modules=["moe", "moe_act"],  # Recompute MoE-specific modules
)
```

For MoE training, it is often better to start with selective recomputation of
MoE-side modules, normalization, activation functions, or model-specific
up-projection modules than to enable blanket full recomputation immediately.

## Feature Interactions

- TE-scoped CUDA graphs are usually paired with selective recomputation rather
  than full recomputation.
- MoE communication overlap paths often require recomputation settings that are
  more selective than "full."
- At long context, recomputing SDPA-heavy attention internals can cost more than
  recomputing smaller supporting modules.
