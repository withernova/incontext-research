# Qwen 3.5 / 3.6

[Qwen3.5](https://huggingface.co/collections/Qwen/qwen35) is a family of vision-language models supporting multimodal understanding across text, images, and videos. Qwen3.5-VL includes both dense models and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) variants for improved efficiency at scale.

[Qwen3.6](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B) shares the same architecture as Qwen3.5 VL MoE (`Qwen3_5MoeForConditionalGeneration`) and is supported through the same bridge implementation.

Qwen 3.5/3.6 models feature a hybrid architecture combining GDN (Gated DeltaNet) layers with standard attention layers, SwiGLU activations, and RMSNorm. MoE variants use top-k routing with shared experts for better quality.

Qwen 3.5/3.6 models are supported via Megatron Bridge with auto-detected configuration and weight mapping.

```{important}
Use `transformers` >= 5.2.0 for Qwen3.5 and >= 5.8.1 for Qwen3.6.
```

## Examples

For checkpoint conversion, inference, finetuning recipes, and step-by-step training guides, see the [Qwen 3.5 Examples](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Megatron-Bridge/blob/main/examples/models/qwen/qwen35_vl/README.md).

### Text-only pretraining

The Qwen3.5 9B and 35B-A3B recipes can pretrain only the language-model
component of the unified models. They derive the registered language-model
provider from the nested Hugging Face `text_config`; no vision model,
projection, processor, or multimodal dataset is created.

```python
from megatron.bridge.recipes.qwen import qwen35_text_9b_pretrain_config

config = qwen35_text_9b_pretrain_config()
```

The canonical aliases select eight-GPU GB200 BF16 library recipes. The dense
9B recipe, `qwen35_text_9b_pretrain_8gpu_gb200_bf16_config`, uses the same data
parallel topology as the Llama 3 8B GB200 performance recipe, with
module-scoped CUDA graphs so library correctness checks remain enabled. The MoE recipe,
`qwen35_text_35b_a3b_pretrain_8gpu_gb200_bf16_config`, uses the applicable Qwen3.5-VL
GB200 HybridEP settings with learned routing. Both retain library-recipe
training, evaluation, logging, checkpointing, and correctness defaults. Set
`config.dataset.blend` (or `config.dataset.data_path`) to use a prepared
Megatron indexed text dataset.
