# Qwen3-Omni

Qwen3-Omni is a multimodal Qwen family model with text, image, video, and audio inputs. Megatron Bridge support for Qwen3-Omni reuses the existing Qwen3-VL language and vision path, and adds Qwen3-Omni-specific audio handling and checkpoint mappings.

The current implementation focuses on checkpoint conversion, training-oriented multimodal forward paths, and smoke-level validation. It includes a full example workflow (HF -> Megatron -> HF export, single-rank inference) and a multi-node training recipe entrypoint.

## Current Support

- Hugging Face to Megatron Bridge checkpoint conversion for `Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct`
- Megatron Bridge to Hugging Face export for the same model family
- Text, image, video, and audio multimodal forward paths
- Qwen3-Omni-specific multimodal RoPE handling for Megatron Bridge runtime
- Single-GPU smoke validation with a vertically trimmed checkpoint
- Multi-node training recipe entrypoint (see Qwen3-Omni examples)
- L0 conversion test coverage for Qwen3-Omni

## Known Limitations

- Megatron inference with `inference_params` is not implemented yet
- `packed_seq_params` is not implemented yet
- Automated validation coverage remains single-rank; multi-node training requires user execution
- Functional smoke tests require user-provided local multimodal assets
