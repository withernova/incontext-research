# Gemma 4 VL Examples

This directory contains example scripts for the Gemma 4 26B-A4B vision-language model.

Gemma 4 26B-A4B is a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) VLM with a SigLIP vision encoder and a 26B sparse language model (4B active parameters). It requires dedicated handling compared to dense VLMs due to its MoE architecture and expert parallelism requirements.

## Requirements

Gemma 4 requires `transformers>=5.5.0`. To upgrade:

```bash
uv pip install -q --upgrade 'transformers>=5.5.0' mistral_common
```

All scripts in this directory run `uv run --no-sync` to prevent `uv` from reverting the upgrade.

## Workspace Configuration

All scripts use a `WORKSPACE` environment variable to define the base directory for checkpoints and results. By default, this is set to `/workspace`. You can override it:

```bash
export WORKSPACE=/your/custom/path
```

Directory structure:
- `${WORKSPACE}/models/` - Converted Megatron checkpoints
- `${WORKSPACE}/results/` - Training outputs and experiment results

## Checkpoint Conversion

### Import HF → Megatron

```bash
uv pip install -q --upgrade 'transformers>=5.5.0'
./scripts/conversion/convert.sh import \
    --hf-model google/gemma-4-26B-A4B \
    --megatron-path ${WORKSPACE}/models/gemma-4-26B-A4B
```

### Export Megatron → HF

```bash
./scripts/conversion/convert.sh export \
    --hf-model google/gemma-4-26B-A4B \
    --megatron-path ${WORKSPACE}/models/gemma-4-26B-A4B/iter_0000000 \
    --hf-path ${WORKSPACE}/models/gemma-4-26B-A4B-hf-export
```

See the [conversion.sh](conversion.sh) script for more examples including multi-GPU round-trip validation.

## Inference

Use the [Gemma 4 26B-A4B-it model verification
card](../../../model_verification_cards/gemma-4-26b-a4b-it/card.yaml) as the canonical source for supported inference.
The card records the immutable Hugging Face revision, verified Bridge commit, checkpoint prerequisite, parallelism
topology, input image, prompt, expected output, and last verification date.

Run only an inference item whose card status is `verified`, and use its command without changing the recorded topology or
inputs when reproducing the verified result. Other combinations have not passed the same verification gate and should not
be inferred from older standalone examples.

## Finetune Recipes

Available recipes:
- `gemma4_vl_26b_sft_config` — Full supervised fine-tuning
- `gemma4_vl_26b_peft_config` — LoRA parameter-efficient fine-tuning

Before training, ensure the following environment variables are set:
1. `WORKSPACE`: base directory for checkpoints and results (default: `/workspace`)
2. `HF_TOKEN`: to download models from HF Hub (if required)
3. `HF_HOME`: (optional) to avoid re-downloading models and datasets
4. `WANDB_API_KEY`: (optional) to enable WandB logging; set `WANDB_MODE=disabled` to turn off

### Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)

Use the verified `sft.H100` command in the [Gemma 4 26B-A4B-it model verification
card](../../../model_verification_cards/gemma-4-26b-a4b-it/card.yaml). It launches the public
`scripts/training/train.sh` entry point and records the exact checkpoint, dataset revision, topology, memory settings,
metrics, and expected result.

The verified recipe owns its TP4/PP1/EP8/ETP1 topology and selective `core_attn` plus `moe_act` recompute settings. Do
not replace them with manual TP, PP, EP, or ETP overrides when reproducing the card result. The former model-specific
SFT launchers were removed because their hard-coded topologies diverged from the verified recipe.

### Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA

For single-node interactive runs, see [peft.sh](peft.sh).

For multi-node Slurm jobs, see [slurm_peft.sh](slurm_peft.sh). Default configuration: TP=2, PP=1, EP=4 on 1 node (8 GPUs).

```bash
sbatch slurm_peft.sh
```

### Verified Configurations

| Mode | Verified hardware | Topology | Global Batch Size | Learning Rate | Notes |
|------|-------------------|----------|-------------------|---------------|-------|
| Full SFT | 8 H100 GPUs | TP4/PP1/EP8/ETP1 | 32 | 5e-5 | Freeze vision; selective `core_attn` and `moe_act` recompute |
| LoRA | 4 H100 GPUs | TP2/PP1/EP4/ETP1 | 32 | 2e-4 | Train language-model adapters; no recompute |

The model verification card is authoritative for the commands, immutable inputs, Bridge commit, metrics, and current
verification status of these configurations.

> **Note:** Do not use `recompute_granularity="full"`. Megatron's `CheckpointFunction` does not support non-tensor (tuple) arguments, causing a `TypeError` at runtime. Use `"selective"` instead.


### Expected Training Dynamics

We provide a [Weights & Biases report](https://api.wandb.ai/links/nvidia-nemo-fw-public/r7dgbroo) for the expected loss curves and grad norms.

## Evaluation

Use the [Gemma 4 26B-A4B-it model verification
card](../../../model_verification_cards/gemma-4-26b-a4b-it/card.yaml) as the canonical source for checked-in training,
export, and deterministic inference evidence. Run only items marked `verified`; an item without a checked-in command is
not a supported evaluation workflow.

## LoRA Merge

After LoRA training, export Hugging Face weights with the adapter weights merged into the base model. The script reads the base checkpoint path from `run_config.yaml` inside the LoRA checkpoint directory, so `--pretrained` is usually not required. Match `--tp` and `--ep` to the parallelism used during training.

```bash
uv run python -m torch.distributed.run --nproc_per_node=8 \
  examples/peft/merge_lora.py \
    --lora-checkpoint ${WORKSPACE}/results/gemma4_vl_lora_tp2_pp1_ep4_<JOB_ID>/iter_<NNNNNNNN> \
    --hf-model-path google/gemma-4-26B-A4B-it \
    --output ${WORKSPACE}/results/gemma4_vl_lora_tp2_pp1_ep4_<JOB_ID>_merged \
    --tp 2 --pp 1 --ep 4
```

The output is a merged Hugging Face checkpoint that can be used for downstream inference or serving.

If the node does not have enough GPU memory, add `--cpu` to load and export entirely on CPU (no GPU required, but slower).

## LoRA Adapter Export

Export LoRA adapter weights to HuggingFace PEFT format (`adapter_config.json` + `adapter_model.safetensors`). This lightweight format can be shared and loaded with the `peft` library without distributing the full base model. No GPU required — runs entirely on CPU.

```bash
uv run python examples/conversion/adapter/export_adapter.py \
  --hf-model-path google/gemma-4-26B-A4B-it \
  --lora-checkpoint ${WORKSPACE}/results/gemma4_vl_lora_tp2_pp1_ep4_<JOB_ID>/iter_<NNNNNNNN> \
  --output ${WORKSPACE}/results/gemma4_vl_lora_tp2_pp1_ep4_<JOB_ID>_adapter
```

The output directory contains:

- `adapter_config.json` — LoRA configuration (rank, alpha, target modules)
- `adapter_model.safetensors` — adapter weights only (~3.7 GB for rank-32 on all linear layers)

> **Note:** Gemma 4 global-attention layers use K=V tying — there is no `v_proj` in the HF global-attention modules. The bridge automatically skips exporting the V adapter for those layers, so the exported adapter is compatible with `peft.PeftModel.from_pretrained`.

## Architecture Notes

### Global Attention K=V Tying

Gemma 4 26B-A4B uses an interleaved pattern of sliding-window (local) and full (global) attention
layers. The global attention layers have a unique property: in the HF checkpoint there is no `v_proj`
weight — key and value share the same projection matrix. At checkpoint import the bridge copies the
K rows into the V rows of Megatron's fused QKV weight.

During fine-tuning, K=V tying must be enforced in every forward pass to keep the model
architecturally consistent. This is handled in `Gemma4SelfAttention.get_query_key_value_tensors`
by setting `value = key` after the parent class returns the split Q/K/V tensors.
