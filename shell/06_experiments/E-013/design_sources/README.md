## 🔥🔥🔥 Visual-RFT: Visual Reinforcement Fine-Tuning
We introduce *Visual Reinforcement Fine-tuning (Visual-RFT)*, the first comprehensive adaptation of Deepseek-R1’s RL strategy to the multimodal field. We use the Qwen2-VL-2/7B model as our base model and design a rule-based verifiable reward, which is integrated into a GRPO-based reinforcement fine-tuning framework to enhance the performance of LVLMs across various visual perception tasks.

## 🔥🔥🔥 Visual-ARFT: Visual Agentic Reinforcement Fine-Tuning
Our new work *Visual Agentic Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-ARFT)* is designed for enabling flexible and adaptive agentic abilities for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). With Visual-ARFT, open-source LVLMs gain the ability to browse websites for real-time information updates and write code to manipulate and analyze input images through cropping, rotation, and other image processing techniques. We also present a Multi-modal Agentic Tool Bench (MAT) with two settings (MAT-Search and MAT-Coding) designed to evaluate LVLMs’ agentic search and coding abilities.

## Framework
**Visual-RFT** framework is shown below. The policy model generates a group of responses based on the input. Each response is passed through a verifiable reward function to compute the reward. After group computation of the rewards for each output, the quality of each response is evaluated and used to update the policy model. To ensure the stability of the policy model training, **Visual-RFT** use KL divergence to limit the difference between the policy model and the reference model. For ***more implementation details***, including data generation, the design of the ***verifiable reward***, and other aspects, please refer to our paper.

### OOM Tips 
⏰ Running into OOM (Out-Of-Memory) issues during training is quite common, especially when using GPUs with limited memory. 

🔦 But no worries — here are some helpful **OOM tips** for you:

1. **About distributed training:** You can alleviate memory pressure by specifying the `--deepspeed` argument, e.g. `--deepspeed /src/visual_arft/local_scripts/zero3.json`.  If memory is still insufficient, you can further reduce the load by using: `--deepspeed /src/visual_arft/local_scripts/zero3_offload.json`.

2. **About the number of generations per group in GRPO:** You can reduce GPU memory usage by lowering the `--num_generation parameter`. In the example script, the default value is `--num_generation 8`, but you can try setting it to 4 to save memory. Keep in mind, though, that a smaller `--num_generation` may lead to worse performance.
  
3. **About gradient_checkpointing:** Moreover, setting `--gradient_checkpointing` to `true` can save memory, allowing for a higher `--num_generations` limit, which leads to better training performance. However, it will slow down the training process.

4. **About Image resolution:** If you're still encountering OOM issues, you can also reduce the resolution of the images in the training dataset!

### SFT
We use <a href="https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory">LLaMa-Factory</a> for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of the model. You can convert the downloaded dataset into the corresponding Qwen SFT format for training.

## Evaluation
We conducted extensive experiments on various visual perception tasks, including **fine-grained image classification**, **open vocabulary object detection**, **few-shot object detection**, and **reasoning grounding**. **ViRFT** achieves remarkable performance improvements across these tasks with minimal data and computational cost, significantly surpassing supervised fine-tuning baselines.

> We provide a step-by-step tutorial for using the evaluation code. If you encounter any issues, feel free to open an issue.

### COCO Evaluation
You can use the files in the ```coco_evaluation``` directory for model inference and obtain evaluation results. Our code supports multi-GPU evaluation, and it requires at least two GPUs.

For ***inference***: 
```
cd ./coco_evaluation
python Qwen2_VL_coco_infere.py
```
Please note that some file paths and model paths in ```Qwen2_VL_coco_infere.py``` need to be modified.
```
### line 167-168, change for your model path and model base.
model_path = "./share_models/Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct_RL/"  # RL model
model_base = "./share_models/Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct/"  # original Qwen2-VL model
### line 182, change for your coco val annnotation path
with open('./data/coco/annotations/instances_val2017.json', 'r') as json_file:
### line 224, Modify according to your own image path.
image_path = './data/coco/val2017/'+image['file_name']    
### line 231-241, selecte the categories you want to evaluation
selected_cate = ['bus', 'train', 'fire hydrant', 'stop sign', 'cat', 'dog', 'bed', 'toilet']
### line 350, results save path
with open(f'prediction_results.json', 'w') as json_file:
```
The inference results will be saved in `JSON` format and later used for evaluation.

For ***evaluation***, just run ```./coco_evaluation/evaluation.ipynb``` step by step.

### LVIS Evaluation
You can use the files in the ```lvis_evaluation``` directory for model inference and obtain evaluation results. Our code supports multi-GPU evaluation, and it requires at least two GPUs.

For ***inference***: 
```
cd ./lvis_evaluation
python Qwen2_VL_lvis_infere.py
```
Please note that some file paths and model paths in ```Qwen2_VL_lvis_infere.py``` need to be modified.
```
### line 169-170, change for your model path and model base
model_path = "./share_models/Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct_RL/"  # RL model
model_base = "./share_models/Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct/"  # original Qwen2-VL model
### line 184, change for your lvis val annnotation path
with open('./data/lvis/annotations/lvis_v1_val.json', 'r') as json_file:
### line 228, Modify according to your own image path.
image_path = './data/lvis/' + "/".join(parts[-2:])   
### line 234-242, selecte the categories you want to evaluation
selected_cate = ['horse_buggy', 'die', 'kitchen_table', 'omelet', 'papaya', 'stepladder']
### line 346, results save path
with open(f'prediction_results.json', 'w') as json_file:
```
The inference results will be saved in `JSON` format and later used for evaluation.

For ***evaluation***, just run ```./lvis_evaluation/lvis_evaluation.ipynb``` step by step.

### Classification Evaluation
You can use the files in the ```classification``` directory for model inference and obtain evaluation results. Our code supports multi-GPU evaluation, and it requires at least two GPUs.
```
cd ./classification
python Qwen2_VL_classification_infere.py
```
Please note that the model paths in ```Qwen2_VL_classification_infere.py``` need to be modified.
```
### line 61-63, change for your model path and model base
model_path = "./share_models/Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct_RL/"  # after RL
model_base = "./share_models/Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct/"  # original Qwen2-VL
```
Inference and result computation are performed simultaneously. After the program finishes running, the number of correctly classified items will be displayed in the command line, and the accuracy is obtained by dividing it by the length of the validation set. (Flower102: 2463, Pets37: 3669, stanford cars: 8041, fgvc-aircraft: 3333)

> 🔔 Sometimes, due to environment issues, the model may produce incorrect inferences when `use_cache = None`. You might consider explicitly setting `use_cache = True`.
> `generated_ids = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=1024, use_cache=True)`

### Evaluation Results
*We have conducted **extensive experiments**; please refer to our paper for further details*.


### Case Study
In the following figure, we present some inference examples from **ViRFT**. We observe that the thinking process significantly enhances the reasoning and grounding ability with **ViRFT**. Through **ViRFT**, Qwen2-VL learns to think critically and carefully examine the image to produce accurate grounding results.

We also present some inference cases of the model when handling *fine-grained classification tasks*. These results not demonstrate the strong generalization ability of **ViRFT** across various visual tasks.
